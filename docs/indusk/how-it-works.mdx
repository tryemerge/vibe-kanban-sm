## The Big Picture

InDusk is more than a task board—it's an **intelligent orchestration system** that coordinates AI agents, manages code isolation, and continuously improves project knowledge.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph User["👤 User"]
        Task[Create Task]
    end

    subgraph VK["InDusk"]
        Board[Kanban Board]
        Column[Column with Agent]
        Workspace[Isolated Workspace]
        Context[Context System]
    end

    subgraph Agent["🤖 AI Agent"]
        Work[Do Work]
        Decision[Write Decision]
        Artifact[Create Artifact]
    end

    Task --> Board

    Workspace -->|"Provides context"| Agent
    Context -->|"Injects knowledge"| Agent
    Work --> Decision

## Three Core Concepts

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Isolated Workspaces" icon="code-branch">
    Every task runs in its own git worktree. Agents can't interfere with each other or your main branch.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Workflow Engine" icon="diagram-project">
    Columns are states in a state machine. Define transitions, conditions, and automatic routing.

  <Card title="Context Compounding" icon="brain">
    Agents learn from each task. Knowledge accumulates in a database and injects into future work.

## 1. Isolated Workspaces

When a task starts, InDusk creates a **git worktree**—a separate checkout of your repository on a new branch.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Main[main branch] --> WT1[worktree: task-123]
    Main --> WT2[worktree: task-456]
    Main --> WT3[worktree: task-789]

    WT1 -->|"Agent A"| Work1[Changes]
    WT2 -->|"Agent B"| Work2[Changes]
    WT3 -->|"Agent C"| Work3[Changes]

    style Main fill:#4caf50,color:#fff
    style WT1 fill:#fff3e0
    style WT2 fill:#fff3e0
    style WT3 fill:#fff3e0
```

**Benefits:**
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Safe experimentation**: Failed attempts are easily discarded
- **Clean history**: Each task has its own branch ready for PR

---

## 2. Workflow Engine

Columns aren't just visual—they're **states in a state machine**. Each column can have:

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Agent** | The AI agent assigned to work in this column |
| **Deliverable** | What the agent should produce |
| **Status Mapping** | Maps to task status (todo, in_progress, done) |
| **Transitions** | Rules for moving to other columns |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Backlog
    Backlog --> Development: Start
    Development --> Review: Agent completes
    Review --> Development: Rejected
    Review --> Done: Approved
    Review --> Cancelled: Cancel
    Done --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

### Conditional Routing

Agents write decisions to `.vibe/decision.json`:

```json
{
  "decision": "approve",
  "feedback": "Code looks good, tests pass"
}
```

Transitions can route based on these values:
- `decision = "approve"` → Move to Done
- `decision = "reject"` → Move back to Development (with feedback)

## 3. Context Compounding

This is what makes InDusk special. **Every task improves project knowledge.**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Task1["Task 1: Add Auth"]
        A1[Agent works]
        D1["decision.json with artifact"]
    end

    subgraph DB["Context Database"]
        Art1[Pattern: Auth middleware]
        Art2[ADR: Use JWT tokens]
    end

    subgraph Task2["Task 2: Add User Profiles"]
        A2[Agent works with context]
    end

    A1 --> D1
    D1 -->|"Creates artifacts"| DB
    DB -->|"Injects into prompt"| A2

    style DB fill:#e1f5fe
```

### How It Works

1. **Agent completes work** and writes to `.vibe/decision.json`
2. **Decision can include artifacts**:
   ```json
   {
     "decision": "approve",
     "artifact_type": "pattern",
     "title": "Error Handling Pattern",
     "content": "Always wrap async operations in try/catch...",
     "scope": "global"
   }
   ```
3. **InDusk stores the artifact** in the database
4. **Future agents receive this context** automatically

### Artifact Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `pattern` | Reusable code patterns | "Use React Query for data fetching" |
| `adr` | Architecture decisions | "ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL" |
| `decision` | Specific choices made | "Chose Tailwind over CSS modules" |
| `module_memory` | Knowledge about a file/module | "auth.ts handles JWT validation" |
| `iplan` | Implementation plans | "Step 1: Create schema, Step 2: Add API" |

### Scoping

Artifacts have different visibility:

- **Global**: Always included for all agents
- **Task**: Only for a specific task
- **Path**: Included when working on matching files

## Putting It Together

Here's a complete workflow showing all three concepts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant VK as InDusk
    participant WS as Workspace
    participant CTX as Context DB
    participant Agent as AI Agent

    U->>VK: Create task "Add login page"
    VK->>WS: Create git worktree
    VK->>CTX: Query relevant context
    CTX-->>VK: ADRs, patterns, module memories
    VK->>Agent: Start with task + context

    loop Agent Work
        Agent->>WS: Read/write files
        Agent->>WS: Run commands
    end

    Agent->>WS: Write .vibe/decision.json
    WS-->>VK: Decision + optional artifact
    VK->>CTX: Store new artifact
    VK->>VK: Evaluate transitions
    VK->>VK: Move task to next column

    Note over CTX: Knowledge compounds<br/>for future tasks
```
